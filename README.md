# This is our submision for HackMol 2.0 ,a hackathon organised by NIT jalandhar.

This platform enables us to ask our queries to our peers i.e our batchmates at any point of time of the day .There are many platforms for teacher-student interaction but here want to promote Peer learning and create a hostel like environament in these times of pandemic. We all know that our peers are exactly at the same level of understanding and they can explain us anything in a very short period of time and in a very smart way . Here we dont have to wait for the reply email by our faculties or websites like stack overflow or Quora where we dont know when our question will get answered and also we can't ask our doubts to faculties at any point of time. And the best part is here you will get rewarded for your help unlike other platforms like discord or whatsapp ,so every one will try to give the best explaination of the query asked by his/her batchmate. Getting rewarded for your help is i think a really Cool thing. Here on registering on portal , everyone will get by default of 10 coins , for asking every query 3 coins will be deducted . Now anyone can see that question on portal and answer them . The person who asked the question can Like or Dislike the solution on the basis of whether he/she is satisfied with the explaination or not . The student whose answer will be liked ,will get +5 coins . Now if i have a considerable ammount of coins then i can Redeem them and get some exciting Gift coupons of Amazon,Udemy ,Courseera and other exciting gifts
